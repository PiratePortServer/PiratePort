## Display Item in Chat

It is possible to display your item, which you need to hold in your main hand, by typing *[i]* into the chat. This will send a message with the name of the item into the chat. Players then can hover over the name to see the enchantments and the lore. Normally, only donator ranks use this.

## Colorcodes in Anvil 

Players with a donator rank can use color codes as well as hexa codes in anvils to rename their items.

## Contracts

With our conctracts feature you can safely create and use working concracts for missions. Contracts can be seen on the contract market. If someone doesn't fullfil your contract you can leave negative feedback through the reputation system or a middleman can handle the dispute.
```
A contract serves as a connection between two parties: the employer (the initiator) and the employee (the applicant). It provides the employer with assurances and safeguards for the purpose of hiring an employee to carry out a specific task and subsequently compensating them.

The employer initiates the process by crafting a contract that outlines the designated payment amount and the task's requirements. Different types of contracts exist based on the nature of the task to be accomplished. The employer also specifies a guarantee, which is an upfront payment from the employee. This guarantee can be utilized by the employer if the terms of the contract are not upheld. Assuming all goes smoothly, the employee's guarantee will be reimbursed.

Following this, other individuals can submit proposals for the established contract, engaging in negotiations concerning payment and the guarantee amount. Subsequently, the employer makes a selection among the applicants for the job. The employer has access to all applicants' reviews and reputations, which aids in making an informed decision.

During the course of the contract, both the employer and the employee have the option to mutually terminate it by agreeing upon a specific payment. This process ensures the security of both parties. Furthermore, in some cases, depending on the contract type, the contract might automatically conclude, leading to the transfer of funds to the employee if the task is successfully accomplished.

In instances where issues arise with the contract, the involved parties can seek resolution through a mediator known as a Middleman. These Middlemen are individuals chosen by administrators to address contract-related disputes. If a Middleman renders an unfavorable decision, the affected player can file an appeal, leading to the issue being escalated to an administrator.

Upon completion of the contract, both the employer and the employee have the option to provide feedback about each other. This feedback is visible within the player's Reputation section.
```

There are different contract types that can be used and selected in the contract creation:

| Contract Type | Description |
|-----:|-----------|
|     **Generic**| Generic contracts lack a defined objective. They lack supplementary protective measures. Your responsibility solely involves entering the payment amount (the sum disbursed upon contract completion), the guarantee amount to be paid if the employee's performance is subpar, and the deadline indicating the contract's culmination time.|
|     **Salary Contracts**| Salary contracts bear a resemblance to generic contracts, yet they offer the ability to compensate the employee at regular intervals of x days (with 10 days as the default period). Notably, the salary is consistently provided in advance, ensuring that the employee remains remunerated even prior to the possibility of termination. At the designated intervals, the employee receives their salary, and the contract will naturally conclude if the employer fails to prepay for the upcoming period.    |
|     **Hitman**| Hitman contracts are designed with the objective of eliminating specific individuals. Once the designated targets have been successfully eliminated by the contracted employee, the contract concludes automatically, triggering the payment processing.       |
|     **Exchange**| Exchange contracts provide you with the opportunity to securely trade currency for various items. When all the specified items have been provided as agreed, the contract will be automatically concluded.     |
|     **Lending**| Lending contracts offer players the ability to lend their funds to another individual, accompanied by a predetermined interest rate. This interest rate is calculated on a daily basis. To illustrate, a contract with a 1% interest rate over a 10-day period (which aligns with the contract's duration) would result in a total of 10% interest to be accrued, in addition to the initial amount that needs to be repaid upon the contract's conclusion.      |
